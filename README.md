# overseer
<i>The vendors supported here may use unofficial apis, as some vendors do not supply public apis.</i>

This project is made to have a unified view of any and all investment accounts.
This allows users to get a wholistic view over their holdings in with the valuations 
their brokers use in a convenient way.

# Introduction 
Overseer provides a simple api that can connect to multiple vendors so getting 
a clear picture over your holdings can be simple and centralised.

# Motivation 
The motivation for this interface comes from the lack of tooling that enables 
individuals the ability to keep track of their finances in a streamlined way. 
Usually leading to reliance on tools like excel to rebalance portfolio or re-assess
their circumstances.
